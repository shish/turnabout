	Turnabout Tracker is a project management-ish thing to aid
	<a href="http://www.halfarsedagilemanifesto.org/">half-assed agile software development</a>.
	It's similar to other agile trackers, but doesn't force you into doing agile properly
	if you don't want to.
	It also has features:
	<ul>
		<li>Non-shit text formatting - markdown.
		<li>Custom fields - add CI test status, reviewer, release notes.
		<li>Custom story states - if you want a "code review" step between
		"code written" and "to release", you can do that.
		<li>Story nesting - rather than just "epic" and "story", you can have
		a business goal which contains several new features which are broken
		down into small parts for different people to work on which are broken
		down into individual tasks.
		<li>Sortable epics - because not having that feature is dumb.
	</ul>
