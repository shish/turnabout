	<h3>About Turnabout</h3>
	<div class="ss">
		Turnabout Tracker is a project management-ish thing to aid
		<a href="http://www.halfarsedagilemanifesto.org/">half-assed agile software development</a>.
		It's similar to other agile trackers, but doesn't force you into doing agile properly
		if you don't want to.
		It also has features:
		<ul>
			<li>Non-shit text formatting - markdown.
			<li>Custom fields - add CI test status, reviewer, release notes.
			<li>Custom story states - if you want a "code review" step between
			"code written" and "to release", you can do that.
			<li>Story nesting - rather than just "epic" and "story", you can have
			a business goal which contains several new features which are broken
			down into small parts for different people to work on which are broken
			down into individual tasks.
			<li>Sortable epics - because not having that feature is dumb.
